### Memory Game

The memory game is playable [here](https://lisonallie.github.io/Memory-Game/)

##### Why did I make this game?
I received an assignment to learn javascript by creating a memory game.

##### How does it look?
I decided to go with an environmental theme. Each card is a different type of environment. There are two cards for each environment for matching purposes. They are: desert, tropical, mountains, snow, forest, and underwater.
