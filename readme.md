### Memory Game

The memory game is playable [here](https://lisonallie.github.io/Memory-Game/)

##### Why did I make this game?
I received an assignment to learn javascript by creating a memory game. The objectives were to change things in the DOM, react to keypresses, and detect collisions.

##### How does it look?
I decided to go with an environmental theme. Each card is a different type of environment. There are two cards for each environment for matching purposes. They are: desert, tropical, mountains, snow, forest, and underwater. The back of each card is a beautiful art piece of rainbow tropical leaves. The cards are positioned with Bootstrap4 in 2 lines at lg, 3 and 4 at md and smaller depending on the screen size. There is a small 5px margin between each of the cards.

##### How to play?
As with any memory game, the objective is to match pairs. The same is true for my memory game. You must find pairs of 2 cards until all the cards are matched. Repeat until satisfied. The order of the cards is random each time.
